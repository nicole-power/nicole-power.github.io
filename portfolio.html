          The common rhetoric oft heard reverberating through the likes of Baby Boomers of “Millennials are killing
          XYZ Industry” is a multi-faceted issue. Where there are companies and industries Millennials decide to support
          with their money there will of course always be others that fall to the wayside of obsoletion. The reality
          of the situation, of an economy that does not allow for the luxuries enjoyed by older generations, has seen a
          rise in businesses striving to appeal to the Millennial mindset; to the demand for more sustainable business
          models and eco-friendly practices that put at ease the anxiety of contributing to the mass pollution of an
          environment the younger generations will inherit.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what of companies that choose to exploit these concerns, that would offer a symbolic victory that
          placates consumers but in reality offers negligible improvements towards the continued pollution of the
          environment. Take the airline industry for example, where in past years airlines have united in ditching
          plastic straws on board their flights while refusing to acknowledge the amount of emissions they produce in
          their travels throughout the world. The appearance of sustainability as opposed to the reality of striving to
          build better business practices for our environment are often, in my experience, little more than performative
          activism in the name of capitalism.

          <p>
            I have had the opportunity to work for one of the largest book retailers in Canada and found that the
            business took great pains to present an eco-friendly face to their consumers in order to appeal and appease
            a
            desire for sustainability. Where do the failings of performative activism display themselves? Away from the
            eye of the consumer, where they may purchase their reusable water bottles and literature on how to reduce
            one’s carbon footprint, in a bag made of paper not plastic, unaware that mere feet from them in the backroom
            these items arrive every morning more often than not in individually wrapped plastic packaging.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have all the respect in the world for the individual that strives to lessen their environmental impact
            but buying into and giving one’s money to a corporation whose desire to appear sustainable is little more
            than
            a money grab is a misguided approach. This is especially evident when the eco-friendly appearance does not
            permeate every layer of their production line, when the arrival and unpackaging of new products is
            associated with bags upon bags of non-biodegradable plastic.
          </p>
          <p>
            The United Nations projects that airplane emissions of carbon dioxide will have reached over 900 million
            metric tons in 2018, and then triple by 2050. So while the refusal to use plastic straws and switching
            from plastic to paper bags is of course a step in the right direction, it’s barely even a baby step; it’s an
            infinitesimal move that does little to remedy the airline industry’s impact on the environment and rather
            serves to act as a victory for environmentalism that is solely symbolic in nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            Acts such as these fool individuals into believing that the companies they support are doing their part to
            be more sustainable and does not allow for a conversation that digs at the deeper issues still plaguing our
            environment. It would appear evident that these companies are motivated not by an interest in the health
            of our planet but rather in the interest of lining one’s pockets with the money of Millennials and Gen Z. It
            is an act that fundamentally lacks empathy, to exist in the laps of luxury during one’s brief stay on Earth
            while actively disregarding future generations; those who will inherit the environment that has already
            begun
            to show its damage and will continue to do so until younger generations demand proper action. It’s time we
            kill the industries that indulge in performative activism.

          <p class="indent">How to Talk to Girls at Parties is a science fiction film that is based on a short story by
            Neil Gaiman.
            The
            film is set in 1970’s London and follows a teenaged boy, Enn, who is enmeshed in the local punk rock scene.
            Enn encounters a small collection of alien colonies where he meets Zan, an interstellar visitor who takes
            the
            form of a teenage girl. Though the two characters come from vastly different backgrounds they both exude the
            restlessness that emerges in the rebelliousness of youth. And arguably what is more emblematic of teen angst
            and rebelliousness than punk rock? All in all the film was an enjoyable watch regarding young love
            blossoming
            in the wake of alien visitation. If you, like me, enjoy relatively loony romantic comedies then this is the
            movie for you!</p>

      <h1>Tangles; A Harrowing Tale of Love and Loss to Alzheimer's</h1>

          <p class="indent">In Sarah Leavitt’s graphic memoir Tangles the author constructs a narrative surrounding
            the loss of her
            mother to Alzheimer’s and the associative ramifications this causes on herself as well as her family
            leading from diagnosis to the illness’s progression. I found that the graphic novel format added a level
            of rawness to an already deeply personal story; the illustrations are beautiful and alluring and though
            they lack the polish of a professional this does not hinder the narrative but rather adds a layer of
            intimacy to the story. I think it’s important to make experiences about mental illnesses and diseases more
            accessible so that we as a society may be made more knowledgeable. This harrowing tale of the slow
            degeneration involved in losing one’s mother to Alzheimer’s sheds light on what we still do not know about
            the disease and the ways in which we may approach the subject of mental illness with much more care and
            dignity in our day-to-day lives.</p>

      <h1>The Duality of Oppression Experienced by Women of Colour in Nella Larsen’s <span

        <div class="bg-white txt-left p-3 p-lg-5">
          <p class="indent">Nella Larsen’s Passing explores the themes of oppression experienced not only by people
            of color but
            those facing the multi-layered subjugation from society of being born a black woman. In a country that
            was built and prospered on the exploitation of slavery Larsen’s novel discusses the implications of the
            white populations continued reliance on the skewed power imbalance amongst races; this is achieved
            through the perpetuation of baseless hatred foisted onto the black community through white eyes simply
            for existing in the human form of a darker shade. Passing is a virulent critique against the white
            oppressors that Larsen viewed in her society and yet there are instances in which she can be interpreted
            to rally against their power in her novel. I highly recommend this work, in particular to those looking
            to educate themselves on the pervasiveness of systemic racism and microaggressions that often run
            unchecked in society today. </p>
